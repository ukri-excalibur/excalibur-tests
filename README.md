# ExCALIBUR tests

Performance benchmarks and regression tests for the ExCALIBUR project.

These benchmarks are based on a similar project by
[StackHPC](https://github.com/stackhpc/hpc-tests).

Feel free to add new benchmark applications or support new systems that are part of the
ExCALIBUR benchmarking collaboration.

_**Note**: at the moment the ExCALIBUR benchmarks are a work-in-progress._
