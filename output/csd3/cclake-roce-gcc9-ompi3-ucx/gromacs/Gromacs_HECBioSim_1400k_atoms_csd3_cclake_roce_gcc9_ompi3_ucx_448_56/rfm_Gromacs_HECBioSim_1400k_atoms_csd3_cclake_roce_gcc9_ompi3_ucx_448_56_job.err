Command line:
  gmx_mpi mdrun -s benchmark.tpr -g 1400k-atoms.log -noconfout


Running on 8 nodes with total 8 cores, 8 logical cores
  Cores per node:            1 - 56
  Logical cores per node:    1 - 56
Hardware detected on host cpu-p-288 (the node of MPI rank 0):
  CPU info:
    Vendor: Intel
    Brand:  Intel(R) Xeon(R) Platinum 8276 CPU @ 2.20GHz
    SIMD instructions most likely to fit this hardware: AVX_512
    SIMD instructions selected at GROMACS compile time: AVX_512

  Hardware topology: Full, with devices

Reading file benchmark.tpr, VERSION 5.1.4 (single precision)
Note: file tpx version 103, software tpx version 110
Changing nstlist from 10 to 25, rlist from 1.2 to 1.23

The number of OpenMP threads was set by environment variable OMP_NUM_THREADS to 1

Will use 336 particle-particle and 112 PME only ranks
This is a guess, check the performance at the end of the log file
Using 448 MPI processes
Using 1 OpenMP thread per MPI process


Non-default thread affinity set probably by the OpenMP library,
disabling internal thread affinity
starting mdrun 'Her1-Her1'
10000 steps,     20.0 ps.

step 75 Turning on dynamic load balancing, because the performance loss due to load imbalance is 15.1 %.


step 1000 Turning off dynamic load balancing, because it is degrading performance.


step 5000 Turning on dynamic load balancing, because the performance loss due to load imbalance is 4.0 %.


step 5500 Turning off dynamic load balancing, because it is degrading performance.


step 7500 Will no longer try dynamic load balancing, as it degraded performance.


 Average load imbalance: 8.5 %
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 4.2 %
 Average PME mesh/force load: 0.837
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to PP/PME imbalance: 3.0 %


               Core t (s)   Wall t (s)        (%)
       Time:    43855.578       97.892    44800.0
                 (ns/day)    (hour/ns)
Performance:       17.654        1.359
